You will probably want to assign static IP address to your 
raspberry PI. For IP configuration you need to edit the file

/etc/dhcpcd.conf

And set the following (change IP address according to your preferences):

interface eth0
inform 192.168.1.10
static ip_address=192.168.1.10/24
static routers=192.168.1.1
static domain_name_servers=192.168.1.1  


You will need to restart eth0 interface:

sudo ifconfig eth0 down
sudo ifconfig eth0 up

If it doesn't set the IP address (check with ifconfig command), then
restart the board:

sudo reboot
