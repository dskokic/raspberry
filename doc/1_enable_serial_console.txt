In default Raspberry Pi OS configuration, serial console is not enabled
and therefore neither you will be able to see messages during linux boot
on the console, neither you will be able to execute commands via console.

To enable serial console you must edit the file named config.txt and add
the following line at the bottom of the file:

enable_uart=1

The easiest way to do it is to put the SD card in the card reader of your
PC and edit the file. On Linux you will probably need to mount boot 
partition to some folder, to see the file, like:

mkdir ~/boot

mount /dev/sdb1 ~/boot

vi ~/boot/config.txt
